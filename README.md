Calculates the oscillation of a rigid inverted pendulum
stabilized by vibaration of the base. Utilized to find 
critical transition frequency that makes the inverted 
pendulum stable. Outputs plot of results. 

Omega such that the inverted pendulum is stable was found 
to be approximately 144.72. 

**Commands**

- `./pendulum`: prints raw data
- `make pendulum.png`: makes graph
- `make clean`: Removes extraneous code files
- `make veryclean`: removes executable, log and .png file
