Calculates the oscillation of a rigid inverted pendulum
stabilized by vibaration of the base. Attempts to find 
critical transition frequency that makes the inverted 
pendulum stable. Outputs plot of results. 

**Commands**

- `./pendulum`: prints raw data
- `make pendulum.png`: makes graph
- `make clean`: Removes extraneous code files
- `make veryclean`: removes executable, log and .png file

**Comments on Results**

Something is wrong with the math. Plot does not respond
to changes in omega the way that it should. At this point in
time I can't figure out what else to do, but as soon as I 
do I will update the code and repost the correct data.

##### Current Data
**For Omega = 150**
